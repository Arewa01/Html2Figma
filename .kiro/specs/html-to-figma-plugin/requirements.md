# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a custom HTML to Figma plugin that can parse HTML content and convert it into Figma design elements. The plugin will allow users to import HTML structures directly into Figma as native design components, eliminating the need for expensive third-party solutions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to convert entire websites into Figma designs, so that I can quickly recreate and iterate on existing web designs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a website URL THEN the system SHALL scrape and analyze the complete webpage
2. WHEN the website is processed THEN the system SHALL convert all visual elements to corresponding Figma layers
3. WHEN conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain pixel-perfect accuracy of the original design

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a designer, I want CSS styles to be preserved during conversion, so that the imported design matches the original appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTML contains CSS styles THEN the system SHALL extract and apply equivalent Figma properties
2. WHEN processing CSS properties THEN the system SHALL convert colors, fonts, spacing, and dimensions accurately
3. IF a CSS property has no Figma equivalent THEN the system SHALL apply the closest available alternative

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install and use the plugin within Figma, so that I can access the HTML import functionality directly in my design workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is installed THEN it SHALL appear in Figma's plugin menu
2. WHEN the plugin is launched THEN it SHALL provide a user interface for HTML input
3. WHEN HTML is submitted THEN the plugin SHALL process it and create Figma elements in the current document

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input a website URL and have the entire page converted, so that I can quickly recreate any website design in Figma.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a website URL THEN the system SHALL fetch the complete webpage including all assets
2. WHEN fetching a website THEN the system SHALL download HTML, CSS, images, and fonts automatically
3. WHEN the website uses dynamic content THEN the system SHALL render it properly before conversion

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a designer, I want the converted elements to be editable in Figma, so that I can modify and iterate on the imported design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTML is converted THEN all created elements SHALL be native Figma components
2. WHEN elements are created THEN they SHALL support standard Figma operations (move, resize, style changes)
3. WHEN text elements are created THEN they SHALL remain editable with preserved formatting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want error handling and feedback, so that I understand what happens when HTML cannot be processed correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid HTML is provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
2. WHEN conversion fails partially THEN the system SHALL complete what it can and report issues
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of created elements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a designer, I want all website assets to be properly imported, so that the Figma design includes all images, fonts, and visual elements from the original site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a website THEN the system SHALL download and embed all images used in the design
2. WHEN processing fonts THEN the system SHALL match web fonts to available Figma fonts or provide alternatives
3. WHEN processing background images THEN the system SHALL convert them to appropriate Figma fills

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the conversion to handle responsive designs, so that I can capture websites at different screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting a website THEN the system SHALL allow selection of viewport size (desktop, tablet, mobile)
2. WHEN a responsive design is detected THEN the system SHALL capture the layout for the specified viewport
3. WHEN elements are responsive THEN the system SHALL convert them based on the selected breakpoint
